# 🚗 Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) — Route Optimization Story

## 🧠 What Is the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)?

The Traveling Salesman Problem, or TSP for short, is one of the classic puzzles in computer science and mathematics. Imagine a salesman who needs to visit several cities, but wants to travel the shortest possible distance — saving time, fuel, and effort. The problem asks:

“Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair, what is the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and then returns to the starting city?”

This problem isn’t just theoretical — it’s the foundation for many real-world challenges in logistics, delivery, and route planning.

## 🧳 The Real-World Scenario: Nairobi and Surrounding Towns

For this project, you’re the salesman starting your journey from Nairobi. You need to visit four towns:

### Meru

### Nyeri

### Nandi

### Kericho

### Your goal?

### Start from Nairobi,

#### Visit each town exactly once,

#### And finally, return to Nairobi.

But here’s the catch: instead of guessing the shortest route or measuring as-the-crow-flies distances, you want the actual shortest driving route based on real roads and traffic conditions.

## 📈 Why Is This Problem Difficult?

While it might seem straightforward, the complexity grows fast as you add more towns. The number of possible routes to check is a factorial of the number of towns:

### For 4 towns, that’s 4! = 24 different possible routes.

Each route’s total driving distance must be calculated using real road data — not just straight lines.

That means the problem becomes a lot harder when there are more locations — it’s like finding a needle in a haystack.

## 🧠 How Do We Solve It?

Our solution uses a smart, step-by-step approach:

#### Generate all possible orders in which to visit the towns (called permutations).

#### For each route, use the OpenRouteService API to calculate the real driving distance between stops.

#### Compare all routes and pick the one with the lowest total distance.

#### Use Folium to plot this optimal route on an interactive map — so you can see the path clearly and explore it visually.

## 💡 Why Does This Matter?

Solving TSP and visualizing the solution has huge practical uses:

#### Delivery routing for trucks, motorcycles, and couriers

#### Sales routes for traveling salespeople and representatives

#### Logistics and supply chain planning to save fuel and time

#### Field service visits like maintenance or inspection routes

Optimizing routes saves money, time, and reduces environmental impact — making operations more efficient and sustainable.
